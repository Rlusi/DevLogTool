# DevLogTool
Creates a markdown Devlog file from a template file. don't change that since the code relies on it. if you still want to change it you will have to change parts of the code too.

How it works.
Creates a new log with a Index one higher than the previous Largest Index. this index can be found in the File name, aswell as the current Date and time down to the minute.
the programm then takes a template and replaces the inforamtion like: time, date, Title, and file content  if the user chooses to enter it automaticly. then gets saved in the log folder.
